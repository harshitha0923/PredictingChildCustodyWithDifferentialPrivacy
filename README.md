# PredictingChildCustodyWithDifferentialPrivacy
There are a lot of factors that are considered for deciding which parent gets the
custody of their child post a divorce. Many of these factors that are considered are
sensitive. So, while building a prediction model for the same, it is important that
the model doesnâ€™t defy privacy. So, a differentially private classification model for
predicting the custody of a child is implemented.
